  <h2>UPR이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  Recent advances in the understanding of the
  <strong>regulation of <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfolded_protein_response" target="_blank" title="Unfolded protein responses">UPR signalling</a></u></strong> and its implications in the pathophysiology of disease might open
  new therapeutic avenues.
  <p>The secretory pathway is responsible for the synthesis of one third of all eukaryotic cell proteins, their
  post-translational modification and assembly into
  complexes, and their delivery to precise destinations
  within the cell or their release into the extracellular
  space. Proteins enter the secretory pathway by translocation from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in an unfolded state, where they undergo
  chaperone-assisted folding to acquire their appropriate
  3D conformation.

  </p><p style="margin-top:45px;"> Unlike DNA replication, transcription
  and translation, protein folding is a highly error-prone
  process1.Thus, maintenance of a healthy proteome
  depends on complex quality control mechanisms,
  some of which operate at the level of the ER to promote
  efficient protein folding and trafficking.
